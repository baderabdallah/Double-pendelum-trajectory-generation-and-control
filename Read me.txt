Folder Description

A.Double Pendulum Project includes the following folders
1. Joint space PID matlab/simulink files
2. Joint space PD w/g controlled matlab/simulink files
3. Operational space PD w/g matlab/simulink files
4. Operational space Inverse dynamics matlab/simulink files
5. Report files containting relevant documentation
6. Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB
7. Videos (demonstrations of results)
8. Robotics_2018 (Including theory that the simulation was worked upon)

B.Each of the first 4 simulation files includes
I-Pendulum dynamics m file
II-Parameters m file
III-Planned trajectory m files
IV- Run files
Simulink models and other m files to plot results

Instructions
1.To run the files, first make sure to include Robotics toolbox
to your work place just like any other toolbox
2. Open one of the 4 simulation files, and run file number IV to
run simulation, and produce angle vs time results, and an animation
